# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# # What is the input?
# An Array
# # What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# the mode of the array
# # What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# iterate through array and count instances of numbers or strings
# return item with largest count
# else return none


# 2. Initial Solution
def mode(array)
	mode = []
	mode = array.inject
end




# 3. Refactored Solution
